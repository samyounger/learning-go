# Exercise 5

We are going to learn about testing next. For this exercise, take a moment and see how much you can figure out about testing by reading the [testing documentation](http://godoc.org/testing) & also [Caleb Doxseyâ€™s article on testing](http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/12). See if you can get a basic example of testing working.
